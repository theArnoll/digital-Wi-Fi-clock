These pinouts are all refrencing the online source and datasheet, using affinity, by myself

## Explainations

The notch orientation is always on top, which means the pin 1 is always be at the top-left.

The [RPi Pico 2 series pinout](./RPiPico2.png) is wrote simply and is optimized for this project. There're other labels for labeling the connection of this projects.

I AM thinking to make some clean simple layout pictures for some boards, but that leaves to the future, and I'm not guarantee about it.

### Website recommondation

I'm going to introduce a website I found recently for the pinout of RPi Pico 2, that's [https://pico2.pinout.xyz/](https://pico2.pinout.xyz/). It's under https://pinout.xyz/ and it at least looks great. The pin will be highlight when your cursor is on top of it, and sometimes it's really useful. If it can select multiple pins to highlight at the same time, it would be even better.

## What's "*ForPrint.png" Files?

I have a 57mm thermal printer (Model: PT-210), and I'll print these files out for conveniance. To save paper or to make the pin definition has enough place to be shown, I'll combine multiple ICs or boards into a single picture and rotate it if need to expand horizontal space. After that, I print "*ForPrint.png" files with an Android app called "Thermer". I'm not a paid user, and it can be used free, with a limitation that it'll always print

in the end of every print. (That's also the reason I say I want to save paper)
